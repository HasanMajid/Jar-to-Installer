#Jar-to-Installer
Creates an installer for your java program through with a GUI.

After you have created a jar file, put the jar file into a separate folder with all its dependacies. Then locate the jar file using the GUI, name the installer, and locate where you want the installer to be outputted to.
Lastly, press build and wait until you see the installer.

Requirements:
You will need to have Java 14+ installed on your computer.

Future Plans:
Currently this only creates an installer for windows and I will add support for Linux and MacOS. 
I will also make it so you can use your own jre image to use with the installer.
